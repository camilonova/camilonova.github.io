1. Run this script in the python shell ``./update_books.py``. This will update the list of books read from the goodreads profile.
2. The script will create a `books.json` file.
3. That's it. List of books will be updated according to how it is on the [goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/67012247?shelf=read).
