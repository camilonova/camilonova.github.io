I'm a technology entrepeneur working with global companies, I have a strong background on business and economics, and spend some time learning about marketing and managment.

These are the ones that I'm currently working on it:

If you are a non technical kind of person and run a sucessful business on your own, I can boost your company to scale to millons of customers, just say hello and let me know about your work.
