I recently read about Alberto Perlman the CEO of Zumba, the biggest fitness brand
in the world.

The story itself is very appealing, Alberto was a broke entrepreneur from the dot com
era, and his mother tell him about Alberto Perez and his dancing skills, then the
opportunity became one of the greatest execution story I've known.

Some reading to enjoy:
