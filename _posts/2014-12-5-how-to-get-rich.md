# How to get rich

There's a story of an Italian Billionaire when asked if he had to start over from scratch 
what he'd do. He replied that he'd take any job to make $500, buy a nice suit, then go to 
parties where he'd meet successful people. The implication being that he meet someone 
who'd offer him a job, share an opportunity, etc.

I'm almost 40 and of the 5 career type jobs I've had in my life, 4 came through networking. 
Only 1 came out of applying to a job listing. 

But networking isn't something you just go out and do. It's immensely more effective if 
you have simple people skills. And when I say simple, I mean spend a couple hours 
reading Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People." Read that and 
try it out at a party and you'll be blown away by how effective it is and how after 
meeting and talking with a few people and asking them about themselves, how they'll 
want to help you, without you asking them.

When I asked my old boss who was the most remarkable sales person I've met, what he 
did to improve his sales skills, he told me that right out of college without any 
skills or pedigree degree, he took a job as a limo driver. He was reading 
"How to Win Friends and Influence People" and thought it would be worth trying out. 
He would ask his customers one simple question when they got in the limo, 
"So tell me about what you do." That simple question resulted in a huge increase 
in tips he received. Notice he didn't ask his customers, "What do you do?" There's a 
subtle difference. If you ask the latter, many people will just tell you in a few 
words what they do. If you ask the former, it's an invitation for them to tell you 
their story. Few people will turn that down.

At one point early in my career, I was doing research in the medical field and realized 
I wasn't interested in it or where it would lead. I wanted to make more money and get 
into the business side of things (this was right after the tech crash in the San 
Francisco area), so I spend nearly 9 months relentless applying to jobs, writing cover 
letters, researching companies. With no success. I was doing it all wrong.

One night, my roommate asked if I wanted to go to a party. Sure, no problem. We went. 
I didn't know a single person there. At one point, everyone did shots. I wandered 
back to the kitchen to get a beer. There was one other guy in the kitchen and I 
introduced myself. We talked for a while, I asked him what he did and he said he worked 
in biotech. I mentioned I was looking to get into the field, and he said his company was 
actually hiring. You can guess what my next job was.

There are a million paths to getting rich. And there are countless people who've gotten 
rich who are jerks, tyrants, manipulative, conniving, and all around assholes. When you're 
working in different industries, you'll start to feel that all the successful people are this 
way. But in reality, these are only the people who leave the most lasting impression, not 
because they're the only people who succeed.

But there's unlikely anyone out there successful who wouldn't emphasize the value of people 
skills in succeeding.


## The high level:

**1. Learn relentlessly.** Read books and books on success, people skills and anything that might 
have some inkling of strand of wisdom about success and wealth. Especially read the 
biographies of successful people. In his autobiography, Mark Cuban talks about how we would 
buy and read any book on business that he thought might help. The $15 he'd spend was a 
fraction of the wisdom he picked up was worth. Drew Houston of Dropbox talks about how he 
would spend every weekend reading books on business, sales, marketing, all day long. Every weekend.

**2. Become a people person.** This is a learnable skill or skills. No one is born a great salesperson. 
There may be people (like athletics) with better inborn abilities (outgoing, etc). But the best 
learn, they read, they study, and they practice, relentlessly. A lot of times, those with the 
best given talent, don't end up being the top in the field, because at the start, it comes easy 
to them. The ones that have to work at, work relentlessly and don't ever get complacent. And 
then one morning, they wake up and the effortlessness at sales or marketing or leadership that 
they never thought they would achieve, they now embody.

**3. Work hard.** As an employer, one of the things that stands out the most with employee is a good 
work ethic. It's worth it's weight in gold. Drop your expectations and ego, and put your nose 
to the grind and good things will happen.

**4. Take risks.** Not dumb, fickle risks and not gambles. But smart, calculated risks where you have 
a good chance at succeeding. You won't always succeed, but you will learn a huge amount in the 
process and you will garner an enormous amount of respect from people in doing so. 

## The nitty gritty:

**1. Get a job in a high growth industry.** This is where the quick money and the opportunities 
are. There's a saying how everything rises with the tide. When you're in a fast growth industry 
(or company), the tide is rising.

**2. Work for the best and most recognizable company you can work for.** This gives you instant 
credibility. Starting as an intern at a recognizable company will get you opportunities right away.

**3. Become an expert.** Pick an area within your industry and learn it inside and out. Start 
writing answers on the topic in Quora, start a blog on the topic, network with other experts. 
You'll find pretty quickly that this type of knowledge and expertise will lead to a huge array 
of options.

**4. Create multiple income streams.** Start writing, consulting, tutoring, fixing things, just 
get busy with a second source of revenue. This will get you hungry for more and you'll double 
your learning. You'll see that a job tutoring on the side, can lead to starting your own tutoring 
company on the side. Your marketing consulting job can lead to writing Amazon books on marketing.

**5. Be too busy to spend money.** Feel like you spend too much money? Feel like you don't save 
enough or at all? Get busy working on everything, your job, learning, networking, consulting, 
projects, side jobs, overtime at work and you'll find out you won't spend a fraction of the 
amount of money than before.

**6. Finally, start a company.** Name a billionaire who didn't start a company. Yes, there are 
a few. But they ended up running the company they joined (Sheryl Sandberg, Steve Ballmer, Eric 
Schmidt). Starting a company may seem completely out of reach and unfathomable, but when you've 
done all the preceding steps, it will be the most logical next one. Successful companies don't 
start out with 50 employees and a $10M in revenue, they start out small, tiny and scrappy. They 
start out in their dorm rooms or their parents garages or spare bedrooms. The founders beg, 
borrow and steal to get what they need. Michael Dell started his company by hacking together 
computers in his dorm room. Walmart started as a single variety store in Newport, Arkansas. 
Ever hear of Newport, Arkansas? Yeah, me neither. Richard Branson started out selling records 
by mail, one at a time. Don't look at the most successful people and companies and see where 
they ended up or you'll be overwhelmed. Look where they started and you'll see how it's achievable.
