I like traveling a lot, meeting new people, places and cultures is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. Driving my motorcycle or my car I have come to know places that I had never imagined. I fully recommend traveling to a new place at least twice a year.

This is a map of the places I have had the pleasure to be.
